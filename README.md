# MineralX

## Project Overview

This project appears to be a front-end web application, likely a landing page or informational website. It utilizes React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for its user interface.  Based on the file names and components, it seems to present information about a company or organization involved in digital trends, automation, and other related areas.

## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Modern UI:** Built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS, providing a clean and responsive user experience.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** Utilizes reusable components for easy maintenance and scalability.
*   **Informational Content:** Presents details about the company's mission, vision, key objectives, and member benefits.
*   **Contact Form:** Includes a basic contact form functionality (likely simulated for the static build).

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js:** (version 16 or higher recommended) - [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **npm** or **yarn** (package manager) - npm comes with Node.js, yarn can be installed globally: `npm install -g yarn`

## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd MineralX
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the `client` directory:**

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```

    This will typically start the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

This project appears to be primarily a front-end application without a real backend. The `/api/contact` endpoint is mocked in `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` to simulate form submission.

Example usage (simulated contact form submission):

```typescript
// In client/src/lib/queryClient.ts
export async function apiRequest(
  method: string,
  url: string,
  data?: unknown | undefined,
): Promise<Response> {
  // Mock contact form endpoint
  if (url === "/api/contact" && method.toUpperCase() === "POST") {
    // Simulate network latency
    await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 600));
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({ message: "Спасибо! Мы свяжемся с вами в ближайшее время." }),
      {
        status: 200,
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      },
    );
  }

  // ... other potential logic
  return new Response(null, { status: 404 }); // Default for non-mocked requests
}
```

**Note:** This is a simulated API call. To implement a real contact form, you would need to set up a backend server to handle the form submissions.

## Configuration Options

Currently, there are no specific configuration options outlined in the provided file structure. However, you might consider adding environment variables (using `.env` files) to manage settings like API endpoints, theme colors, or other application-specific configurations as the project evolves.
